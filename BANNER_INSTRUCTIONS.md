# Banner Image Instructions

## Adding Your Banner Image

Your portfolio is now set up with the banner image integrated! Here's what you need to do:

1. **Place your banner image** in the `public` folder
   - Name it exactly: `banner.jpg` (or `banner.png` if it's a PNG)
   - The image should be a wide banner format (recommended: 1400x800px or similar wide aspect ratio)
   - The code is already set up to use `/banner.jpg`

2. **The banner is already integrated** in `components/hero.tsx`
   - The Image component is already in place
   - It will automatically display once you add the image file
   - The banner height is set to 600px (mobile), 700px (tablet), and 800px (desktop)

The banner section:
- Full-width container with rounded corners
- Height: 600px (mobile) → 700px (tablet) → 800px (desktop)
